CommunicatiCommunication Assistance Platform

The Communication Assistance Platform is a web-based accessibility-focused project developed by Team Algonary with the goal of supporting individuals who experience speech and communication disorders. The platform demonstrates how modern web technologies and AI-driven concepts can be combined to create inclusive, human-centered assistive solutions.

This project provides multiple communication methods in a single unified interface. Users can convert typed text into natural-sounding speech using Text-to-Speech, communicate through symbol-based AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) boards, and use real-time Speech Recognition to convert spoken words into text. In addition, the platform includes phrase prediction features that assist users by suggesting commonly used phrases based on input patterns.

Accessibility is a core design principle of this system. The interface includes customizable controls such as adjustable font size, high-contrast mode, and multiple visual themes (default, dark mode, and colorblind-friendly). These features ensure that the platform can adapt to diverse user needs and improve usability across devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile browsers.

From a technical perspective, the project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive and responsive frontend. Browser-based APIs such as the Web Speech API are leveraged for speech synthesis and recognition. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing future integration of backend services, machine learning models, analytics, and secure user authentication.

This project is currently a prototype and academic/innovation-focused implementation, created for learning, demonstration, and evaluation purposes. It reflects a practical approach to solving real-world accessibility challenges using technology, rather than a production-ready commercial system.
